    Development on this project has ceased in favor of `<https://pypi.org/project/routes-18xx/>`_. Whereas routes-1846 was focused specifically on 1846: Race for the Midwest, routes-18xx can support most 18xx games.

A library for calculating optimal routes for each train (by revenue) for the board game "1846: The Race For The Midwest".

Usage instructions forthcoming. For now, check out the `related web app <https://routes1846.herokuapp.com/>`_.
